## Script for setting up LAMP stack on debian based servers 

This script can be deployed on any debian based server in order to quickly set up a LAMP stack via docker containers. 

## USAGE

Transfer the script to the destination server using any preferred protocol. SCP is a good option for secure transfer. 

Make sure the script is executable by running:
    $ chmod +x werbserver-setupscript.sh 

Run the script as sudo: 
    $ sudo ./webserver-setupscript.sh 

And wait for it to finish.
